Description: Imbalanced classification is a challenging issue in data mining and machine learning. To address this issue, a large number of solutions have been proposed. We introduce an R library called IRIC, which integrates a wide set of solutions for imbalanced classification. IRIC not only provides a new implementation of some state-of-art techniques for binary imbalanced classification, but also improves the efficiency of model building using parallel techniques. The library and its source code are made freely available.
